Div id for the user-defined tags: id="app_taggin_modal"
Underneath this id there is a class: class="app_tags popular_tags"
Within this class are several div classes labelled "app_tag_control popular",
each contains a corresponding data-tagid.
E.g. PvP = data-tagid="1775"
Within each "app_tag_control popular" there is a single href, which has the category in it.

HtmlGrab and TagGrab can already benefit from a refactoring.
Currently, when grabbing tags (or extracting a div) we always overwrite a temporary file
called "outputs/output.html", however it might be easier for HtmlGrab to just return an
object or a list of strings instead of outputting files. TagGrab as well.

A few notes:
-I've made a C "blobber" for files, we could store images with this.
-app_id can be [PK] for game entities
-data-tagid can be a [PK] for the genre/tag entities
-Beautiful Soup library for html contents?
