Div id for the user-defined tags: id="app_taggin_modal"
Underneath this id there is a class: class="app_tags popular_tags"
Within this class are several div classes labelled "app_tag_control popular",
each contains a corresponding data-tagid.
E.g. PvP = data-tagid="1775"
Within each "app_tag_control popular" there is a single href, which has the category in it.

Extra stuff:
-I've made a 'blobber', which can convert image files into blob format; we could store images
in our database this way.
-app_id can be [PK] for game entities
-data-tagid can be a [PK] for the genre/tag entities
