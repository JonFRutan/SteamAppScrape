# SteamAppScrape
Some scraping tools tailored to Steam Apps.  
This is an updated version pulled from a class repo.  
This is coauthored by myself and Trevor Corcoran.  

## extractors  
I've left in my prior work but using BeautifulSoup4 was much more efficient.  
Using scrape.py will require BeautifulSoup4.  

## importers  
This is where importing scripts and programs should go.  
Currently there is only the import.py script which initiates a SQL connection via SQLAlchemy.  
This will pull from a local .env file (must be made by enduser).
