# SteamAppScrape
Some scraping tools tailored to Steam Apps.  
This is an updated version pulled from a class repo.  
This is coauthored by myself and Trevor Corcoran.  

## extractors  
I've left in my prior work but using BeautifulSoup4 was much more efficient.  
Using scrape.py will require BeautifulSoup4.  

## importers  
This is where importing scripts and programs should go.  
Currently there is only the import.py script which initiates a SQL connection via SQLAlchemy.  
This will pull from a local .env file (must be made by enduser).  

### NOTE  
This will be updated once the class project is finished, and will contain all the relevant information from there.  
For the time being this is solely the project script code for the sake of showcase.
